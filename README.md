- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I stepped back into Frontend Development with this project as it's been some time since I've worked on HTML/CSS. I've been spending time on algorithms. I struggled with the vertical size of the parent div being large enough to hold the children elements. I solved this by using the below:

```css
    .qr-container {
        height: auto;
    }
```

### Continued development

I would like to grow into using CSS best practices that are efficient and scalable. I would like to continue focusing on the way parent width plays with children elements.
